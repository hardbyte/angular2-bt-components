# Introduction


Forked from `mgechev`'s seed project for Angular 2 apps.

Just a place to keep a few common components and examples of using them.

# How to start

**Note** that this seed project requires node v4.x.x or higher and npm 3.x.x.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed.git
cd angular2-seed
npm install   # or `npm run reinstall` if you get an error
npm start     # start with --env dev
npm run docs      # api document for app
```
_Does not rely on any global dependencies._
